                        </p>
                        <p>I am French engineer in Computer Science, living in
                        Paris. I am 23 years old. I may be a bit too much
                        <strong>computer geek</strong>, playing at various
                        levels of the stack, but focusing on web applications
                        programming.</p>
                        <p>I love writing code, in <strong>Javascript</strong>,
                        <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong> or
                        <strong>C++</strong> and use cutting edge an freaky
                        techs.</p>
                        <p>I also enjoy using and working on my installations of
                        <strong>Archlinux</strong> and <strong>Debian</strong>.
                        Sometimes I work under Windows or MacOS, but it’s not
                        my cup of tea. Oh, btw, <strong>git</strong>hub is my
                        favorite social network, twitter wins the silver medal
                        : not enough code!</p>
                        <p>I’m keen on cinema, music and I like to have a drink
                        with my friends.</p>

                        <h3>Present</h3>
                        <p>I am currently <acronym title="Chief technology officer">CTO</acronym>
                        at <a
                            href="http://mixotv.com">Mixotv</a>, a personalized
                        and social TV-guide which recommends shows fitting your
                        tastes.</p>
                        <p>We released the first iPhone version of the
                        application in January 2013, the project is still in
                        its early stages, but growing fast!</p>
                        <p>Mixotv is mostly written in PHP using Symfony2, but
                        we also deal with Javascript and Python. We use
                        PostgreSQL a lot, Solr and Rabbitmq. Currently, my main
                        concern is building a technical architecture that
                        scales, quite a challenge actually.</p>
                        <h3>Past</h3>
                        <p>I worked as a freelance on various projects. I built
                        websites and wrote articles for a magazine called PHP
                        Solutions (in French).</p>
                        <p>Before graduation, I had three internships.</p>
                        <p>I spent 4 months at
                        <a href="http://commonit.com">CommonIT</a> a startup
                        building an iPad application able to control a browser
                        executed remotely on a server, without significant lag.
                        It allowed to browse websites built with Flash,
                        including video, audio, mouse and keyboard
                        interactions. The fun part was that I used an
                        experimental port of Qt4 for iOS.</p>
                        <p>I also worked 3 months in an IT services company on
                        the e-commerce website of a famous sportswear brand,
                        with Magento - and 2 months in a laboratory of the
                        University of Burgundy, I wrote in C a tool performing
                        graph processing.</p>

                                <p>I graduated from the <strong>Insa de Lyon</strong>,
                                a French top-tier school of a Master of Engineering
                                degree in 2012.</p>
                                <p>Previously, I obtained a DUT Informatique (a two
                                years diploma), from the University of Burgundy with
                                honors.</p>

                            <p>I listen to a lot of music, but I don't play an
                            instrument. I love cinema and video games. I casually
                            practice swimming and climbing about once a week.</p>
                            <p>I am interested in politics and I enjoy
                            learning stuff completely unrelated to my work.</p>
                            <p>I love travelling, even if I only had few
                            occasions for so far.<p>

                            <p><a href="http://github.com/Martiusweb/lisogo">On github</a></p>
                            <p>Lisogo is my current pet project. The goal is to
                            build a simple service allowing people sharing
                            goals and objectives to get in touch with each
                            other.</p>
                            <p>Lisogo is built in Python, with mongodb. This is
                            my second project using Python and my first with
                            Mongodb.</p>
                            <p>Currently, lisogo is nothing more than a simple
                            ODM I wrote myself, since I did not wanted to use
                            a big ODM not as flexible and <em>simple</em> as
                            I wanted.</p>
                            <p>The ODM does almost everything I need to start
                            the real project.</p>

                            <p>I included a setup script that makes the

                        I did not test it with bash since a lot of time, and
                        the promised setup script does not exist.  But there
                        are only a few lines to edit. You'd rather use
                        a project like Oh-my-zsh.</p>

                        <p>This was a pet project I've been working on during
                        a sprint of a few days in order to strengthen my skills
                        in raw Javascript, canvas and an opportunity to try
                        node.js and websockets.</p> <p>It is a classic pong
                        game playable online.</p>

                        <p>It stands for "Yet another Php Documentor",
                        something that is actually hard to find, since most of
                        the time these tools don't support recent features of
                        the language.</p>
                        <p>Actually, I wrote the parser, but not the
                        whole documentation generator, since I didn't get much
                        interest on the project from the community (but
                        I didn't try really hard at the time).</p>

                            <p>Sometimes I write articles about code,

                        <article>
                        <p>I write on French on a blog called <a
                            href="http://feston.fr">Feston.fr</a>. I talk about
                        mostly anything, but with a strong focus on music and
                        cinema. This is not a <em>personal</em> blog, my
                        friends write on it too, sometimes.</p>

                        <article>
                        <p>I really love music, even if I don't play an
                        instrument. I'm like, <em>always</em> listening to
                        music.</p> <p>I build playlists. My biggest unsorted
                        and unfiltered playlist is on <a href="http://hypem.com/martiusweb">The
                        hype machine</a>. It's always updated.</p>
                        <p>I have a <em>lot</em> of playlists on
                        <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/1157433704">Spotify</a>.</p>
                        <p>I've got stuff on Soundcloud, but I don't remember
                        what.</p>

                        <article>
                        <p>I enjoy cinema and I sometimes write reviews in
                        French. These reviews are on <a
                            href="http://feston.fr">Feston.fr</a> or <a
                            href="http://blog.martiusweb.net">my old blog</a>.</p>
                        <p>I also wrote an analysis on Christopher Nolan's
                        movies, in French too. This is an analysis focusing the
                        construction of the story and the narrative process
                        Nolan uses in its movies. You can read this on a small
                        website called <a
